        INTRODUCTION TO U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span></p>
    <p class="text">
        Occupational risk assessment has traditionally been based on estimated airborne
        concentrations of chemical substances in comparison with occupational exposure limits
        (OELs). The pulmonary route of exposure has been identified as the main route of
        exposure in industrial hygiene. Only in the last two decades has the issue of occupational
        health risk posed by dermal exposure been explored. Given the significant decrease
        in OELs over the past 50 years and the substitution of several volatile agents by
        substances that are not or that are scarcely volatile, dermal exposure is expected
        to play an increasingly significant role in occupational hygiene.</p>
    <p class="text">
        While risk assessment strategies for airborne pollutants at the workplace have long
        been available, cutaneous risk assessment still seems to suffer from a lack of practical
        tools. In particular, the complexity of the various chemical, physical and physiological
        processes leading to a chemical reaching a target organ through the skin has prevented
        the elaboration of exposure limits that would be equivalent to the inhalation occupational
        exposure limits (OEL).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Just as OEL such as the Threshold limit values (TLV) from the American Conference
        of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) are the bread and butter of day-to-day
        occupational risk assessment for airborne exposure, Skin notations are currently
        the main tool available to hygienists and occupational physicians in order to identify
        potential risks attributable to systemic toxicity following dermal exposure. The
        criteria used for assigning a notation generally include one or more of the following
        depending on availability: experimental data on dermal absorption in human or animals,
        studies reporting toxic effects following skin exposure, in vitro estimates of dermal
        penetration, acute dermal toxicity data in animals and quantitative structure-activity
        relationship (QSAR) models, suggesting an elevated skin absorption potential. However,
        a methodological framework in order to assess health risk associated with dermal
        exposure still seems to be lacking. The transparency and rigorousness of the skin
        notation assignment process have thus been recently questioned, and recent studies
        have shown significant differences when several list of OELs containing skin notations
        were compared.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        We developed the U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        tool (‘Utilitaire sur le risque PERCUTané des substances chimiques’) to provide
        occupational health practitioners with a better portrait of the potential of a substance
        for cutaneous penetration and systemic toxicity than that given by the yes/no answer
        from skin notations.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        The contributions of the U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        tool include:
    </p>
    <ul class="intro">
        <li>Summarizing information relevant for cutaneous exposure from several existing databases</li>
        <li>Calculating a screening hazard index based on existing QSAR equations that compare
            the potential systemic dose caused by skin exposure to a dose equivalent to inhalation
            exposure to a respiratory OEL.</li>
        <li>Provide a quantitative uncertainty analysis of the hazard index so that final decisions
            be made taking into account this uncertainty.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="title">
        BASIC FUNCTIONS OF THE TOOL</p>
    <p class="text">
        The user selects a chemical substance either from a dropdown list or using a basic
        search function based on name or CAS number.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Once the chemical is selected, the following information is provided (see <a href="help.pdf">
            help file</a> for more information):
    </p>
    <ul class="intro">
        <li>CAS number</li>
        <li>Risk phrases from former European legislation relevant to skin exposure Classification
            of the substance as carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic according to European
            legislation </li>
        <li>Classification of the substance as carcinogenic, mutagenic or reprotoxic according
            to European legislation</li>
        <li>Presence of skin notation on the ACGIH-TLV or german MAK-BAT lists of OELs</li>
        <li>Intrinsic potential for dermal penetration based on molecular weight and octanol-water
            partition coefficient</li>
        <li>Summary of animal oral and dermal toxicity from the RTECS database (see below) translated
            into the new Globally Harmonized System</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
        The next step is for the user to choose a dermal exposure scenario for the selected
        substance. This includes surface of the body exposed (selection of body parts exposed),
        duration of exposure (in min.) and presence/absence of significant simultaneous
        inhalation exposure.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        After selection of a scenario, U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        estimates a Dermal Hazard Index (DHR). This quantity represents the ratio of the
        cutaneous dose to the dose that would be reached if the worker was exposed 8 hours
        at a respiratory OEL. This estimation is accompanied by an uncertainty analysis
        based on Monte Carlo simulation, which allows for example to know the probability
        that the true DHR value would exceed 1 (i.e. cutaneous dose greater than the dose
        deemed acceptable based on inhalation). See below for a description of how DHR is
        calculated.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        Based on the information summarized by U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        and the estimated DHR value and its uncertainty, the user can decide of a course
        of action, which may include taking no further action regarding potential skin exposure,
        performing a comprehensive dermal exposure assessment study, conducting a biomonitoring
        survey, or implementing dermal protection measures.

        DERIVATION OF A DERMAL HAZARD INDEX (DHR)</p>
    <p class="text">
        This section provides a brief overview of the calculations used to derive the DHR.
        The complete and detailed approach used can be found in the <a href="./percut-lavoue-etAl.pdf">
            scientific report</a> (PDF file).
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        The DHR was calculated using the following general equation:
    </p>
    <table style="width: 900px; margin-left: 1em;">
        <tr>

                            <i>DHR</i>&nbsp;=&nbsp;

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td style="border-top: 1px solid black; text-align: center; padding: 0 1em 0 1em;">
                            <i>reference.dose</i>
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                </table>

            <td style="width: 33%">
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p class="text">
        <i>cutaneous.dose</i> refers to a dose in mg of substance expected to cross the
        skin and enter the blood system. It depends on the duration of exposure, surface
        of skin exposed, and an estimation of transdermal flux. The first two quantities
        are selected by the user. The third is estimated from a QSAR equation (see above).
        This estimation assumes exposure of the chosen surface to an infinite quantity of
        the substance in a saturated aqueous solution, and that steady state has been reached.
        The parameters used to estimate the transdermal flux include molecular weight, octanol-water
        partition coefficient, and water solubility. For gaseous substances, the Henry constant
        is used to estimate the concentration of an aqueous solution in contact with skin
        in equilibrium with the vapor concentration set at the OEL.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        <i>reference.dose</i> refers to an internal dose of the substance deemed safe for
        the worker. We derived it by assuming 8 hour inhalation exposure at the OEL with
        a respiratory absorption fraction of 75%.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        When the DHR is above 1, it means that the dose potentially received through the
        skin would be equivalent or greater to a dose regarded as safe when received through
        inhalation repeatedly day after day over an entire career.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        On the DHR screen, both levels 100% of reference dose (DHR=1) and 10% of reference
        dose (DHR=0.1) are illustrated. The 10% threshold is shown because it has been mentioned
        as a criterion for assigning a skin notation to chemicals, and also because we recommend
        its use when the user indicated that simultaneous inhalation exposure is taking
        place in addition to skin exposure.
    </p>
    <p class="title">
        ESTIMATING A REFERENCE DOSE FOR THE DHR CALCULATION</p>
    <p class="text">
        As presented in the previous section, the derivation of DHR requires the availability
        of a reference dose. Most approaches from which our tool is inspired used OELs to
        derive a reference dose. Hence, these values represent an exposure concentrations
        regarded as safe to breathe by reputable organizations and are based on the integration
        by expert of all available toxicological data. However, OELs are available for only
        a fraction of existing chemicals. Moreover many different values of OEL may exist
        for a single substance depending on the organization, and they sometimes are based
        on local toxic effect such as irritation, not relevant to systemic toxicity.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        We developed an OEL database using several sources including the 2010 ACGIH-TLVs,
        the German 2009 MAK values, and OELs from many countries and organizations reported
        in the RTECS database. We used this database to maximize the number of chemicals
        in our tool for which an OEL would be available. We also used it in our calculations
        to take into account variations in OEL values across organizations for the same
        chemical.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        When no OEL was available for a substance, we used correlation analyses between
        available OELs and animal toxicity data reported in RTECS to estimate a reference
        dose.
    </p>
    <p class="text">
        The U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span> tool
        issues two different warnings regarding references doses: 1) when the available
        OEL is known to be based on local toxicity, to the effect that risk is potentially
        overestimated if systemic effects occur at much higher doses, 2) when the reference
        dose has been derived using animal toxicity data, to the effect that the DHR estimated
        is more uncertain.
    </p>
    <p class="title">
        APPROACH FOR THE UNCERTAINTY ANALYSIS</p>
    <p class="text">
        As can be seen on the DHR screen, the U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        tool does not only provide one DHR value but rather a distribution of possible values.
        The text box on the DHR screen provides the probability that the ‘true’ DHR is less
        than or greater than the chosen threshold (100% or 10%). The uncertainty estimated
        around each DHR value is substance specific and includes the following parameters:
    </p>
    <ul class="intro">
        <li>Imprecision in octanol-water coefficients</li>
        <li>Imprecision in water solubility</li>
        <li>Uncertainty in the QSAR for estimating transdermal flux</li>
        <li>Variations of OELs across organizations</li>
        <li>Uncertainty in predicting a reference dose from animal toxicity data</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">
        In average, the uncertainty estimated around a DHR value when an OEL was available
        corresponds to a ratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile of the uncertainty
        distribution of 200. It means approximately that for a specific chosen scenario,
        the greatest plausible value of DHR is 200 times greater than the smallest plausible
        value. For substances for which an OEL was derived from animal toxicity data, the
        same ratio is 2 000, corresponding to a much greater uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p class="title">
        DISCUSSION</p>
    <p class="text">
        The main strength of U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        is that it addresses present hygienists need to find immediate support in the process
        of decision-making. It is based primarily on the transfer of information from various
        sources: as such U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        can’t be more 'valid' or 'accurate' than these sources would be individually, but
        it presents an overall picture of all existing information. Hence, indices such
        as the risk phrases based on animal toxicity are limited by toxico-dynamics and
        toxico-kinetic extrapolation to humans and to differences between chronic and acute
        effects. QSAR models used to estimate the DHR are based on an equation derived from
        a few hundred substances. In addition to this, the ‘acceptable’ doses are based
        on actual or estimated occupational exposure limits that were developed for exposure
        by the inhalation pathway. This includes OELs that may be relevant mainly to respiratory
        irritation, and the dose associated with such OELs may not pose a similar health
        risk when received by the dermal route. The exposure scenario used to derive DHR
        requires exposure to an infinite quantity of a saturated aqueous solution of the
        contaminant, which is probably rarely effective. Furthermore, U<span style="font-variant: small-caps;
            font-style: italic">percut</span> does not take into account all of the processes
        that can affect dermal absorption, such as losses to evaporation or hand-washing,
        differences in absorption between different areas of the body, metabolisation within
        the skin, dermal integrity, penetration enhancers, and occlusion. In addition, the
        tool is designed to assess the risk of systemic health effects following dermal
        absorption. It does not allow assessment of dermal sensitization. When substances
        that are dermal sensitizers are selected, a warning message is displayed. A similar
        warning message is displayed for possible carcinogens and mutagens to advise users
        that safe levels of exposure may not exist and that minimizing exposure should be
        a priority. Finally, variations in percutaneous penetration according to the location
        on the body exposed or on the skin condition (eg. irritated, moisturized, dry ...)
        were not taken into account. Therefore a series of information that are individually
        of limited value are presented to identify a potential risk associated with skin
        chemical exposure. The quantitative uncertainty analysis provided by U<span style="font-variant: small-caps;
            font-style: italic">percut</span> around the DHR value allows for a transparent
        decision making process. This project endeavored to transfer existing knowledge
        in the field of chemical dermal risk analysis to the practical field of occupational
        hygiene. We insist that U<span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-style: italic">percut</span>
        is not a risk assessment but a hazard assessment tool: it is not designed to provide
        a proper evaluation of risk but to indicate the need to perform such an evaluation.
